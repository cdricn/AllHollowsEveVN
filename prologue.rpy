    #"No one knows what’s inside of it,\n{w=[s]}
    #Not the current royal family, not the previous one.\n{w=[s]}
    #As if it was destined to never open at all.\n{w=[s]}
    #Symbolic of the Royal Family’s eternal rule."

    #The heart of darkness that dwells within man,\n{w=[s]}
    #It seeps into the ground, like trees which nourish from blood.\n{w=[s]}
    #The cave has opened. It is the hollow’s eve."

    "All of them."

    "Mama,{w=[s]} Papa,{w=[s]} my sisters,{w=[s]} Alexei.{w=[s]}
    I couldn’t even see their faces behind the plumes of white smoke.{w=[s]} 
    Could they still be alive?{w=[s]} No, they couldn’t be.{w=[s]}
    The eyes of those men were too angered to let them even breathe a single breath."

    "Oh gods, I was next.{w=[s]} I don’t know where to go anymore.{w=[s]} 
    The forest seemed endless, even though I’ve stepped upon these forests before.{w=[s]} 
    Beneath the night it seemed so foreign."

    "I don’t even know what I did.{w=[s]} I don’t know anything at all.{w=[s]}
    But they’re all dead, aren’t they?"

    "..."

    "They are.{w=[s]} And I’m next.{w=[s]} I’m next.{w=[s]} I’m next."

    Ex "There she is!{w=[s]} Get her!"

    "The ground beneath me crumbled, as if I fell down a hole unseen to the naked eye.{w=[s]}
    If this were a trap I would’ve been killed already, but it wasn’t.{w=[s]}
    It was as though I was sliding, or falling down a cliff."

    #Leaves rustle sfx she fell down a hole

    Ex "Did you get her?"

    Ex "I think so, maybe you were just seeing things?"

    Ex "No, I’m damn sure I saw her."

    Ex "Right, can’t trust you for calling out now, can’t I?{w=[s]} Come on.{w=[s]}
    Keep searching, we need to find them before sunrise."

    Ex "Yes, sir!"

    "Why...{w=[s]} Why did this happen?{w=[s]}
    Am I really deserving of feeling such terror?{w=[s]}
    No.{w=[s]} I am, right?{w=[s]} This is what I get for being born into royalty."

    "I get to enjoy the spoils of my father’s depravity and be depraved myself.{w=[s]}
    He knew this was where we would end up eventually."

    "And yet…"

    "They kept on dancing."

    "I kept on dancing."

    "Did mother want this as well?{w=[s]} Is that why she married father?"

    "I saw Alexei’s eyes right before he was shot."

    "It pleaded with me.{w=[s]} He wanted me to go in front as well."

    I’m so sorry.{w=[s]} I should’ve been there with you, right?"

    An "It would’ve saved me the trouble of having these thoughts too."

    An "Haha…{w=[s]} I’m quite selfish.{w=[s]}
    Right, mother?{w=[s]} You always told me that."

    You said they only sold it in the village below."

    An "I still have it."

    An "But you aren’t here anymore."

    Ax "..."

    An "You forgive me right?"

    An "Please tell me that at least."

    An "I would’ve died with you if you wanted me to."
