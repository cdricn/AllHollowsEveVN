    An "ALEXEI!"

    Tr "Gah!"

    An "...Huh?{w=[s]} Where…{w=[s]} Where am I?"

    "My eyes gradually came into focus as I looked around.{w=[q]}
    Beside me a candle light dimly glows.{w=[q]}
    It illuminated the single room house.{w=[q]}
    Wooden walls, a low hanging ceiling,{w=[q]} in the distance,
    opposite the soft bed I laid upon, was a dining table."

    "And beside me, a bit shocked, but not as fearful as I was, a girl.{w=[q]}
    She was pretty, and far too…{w=[q]} common.{w=[q]}
    Like a deer on the far outskirts of a forest during a snowy day."

    Tr "Ah, goodness.{w=[q]} You’re awake."

    Tr "You haven’t been asleep for long, it was a miracle I found you just on the outskirts."

    Tr "In any case, sorry for talking too much, you might be overwhelmed.{w=[q]}
    But rest assured, you’re safe, Duchess."

    An "Duchess?{w=[q]} You know me?"

    Tr "Of course.{w=[q]} No one in the village doesn’t know you, you’re our duchess!{w=[q]} Revered and noble."

    An "Then you have heard of what occurred earlier today?"

    Tr "We have, unfortunately.{w=[s]} However, the village will do what it can to protect you."

    Tr "They owe you and your family a lot for our continued existence."

    An "Do they...?"

    "I had no idea what this place was.{w=[q]}
    Neither father nor mother mentioned it once in my education.{w=[q]}
    Surely such a loyal village would be mentioned in the event of a catastrophe,
    or at the very least in the ideas of politics."

    "But who am I kidding?{w=[q]} Such ideas were probably passed over to Alexei instead of me."

    "I was not destined for anything in that court, after all."

    "Like all women there, we were just going to be sold off to the highest bidder.{w=[q]}
    The greatest political ally possible.{w=[q]} The only one that had a future there was Alexei."

    Tr "They do!{w=[q]} Don’t worry, do you want to meet them?"

    Tr "When we found you in the outskirts we were worried that you had passed on already."

    Tr "They said the rites would’ve been a lot more complicated had that been the case."

    Tr "But since you’re well, they’re excited to see you!{w=[q]} Hup!"

    An "Huh?{w=[q]} Hey, wait!"

    "She quickly bolted out of the house."

    An "Wait!"

    # footsteps sfx

    An "Hey!{w=[q]} At least tell me what that rite is.{w=[q]} Am I going to die here too?"

    Tr "Huh?{w=[s]} Oh, no.{w=[q]} Please.{w=[q]}
    I didn’t mean it like that.{w=[q]} The rite is… well.{w=[q]} The rite!"

    An "And what is the rite?"

    Tr "The rite of welcoming the saints!"

    Tr "Every few hundred years, someone from the royal family
    does the rites in the cave on the outskirts of the village."

    Tr "And this year is that year."

    An "Oh… I’m sorry,{w=[q]} this rites stuff wasn’t taught to me by my parents.{w=[q]}
    I don’t really know what to do."

    Tr "Don’t worry about it!"

    Tr "You’re the duchess!{w=[q]} Even if you mess up,
    people will think it’s part of the rite."

    An "I see..."

    An "Actually, what happens there?"

    Tr "Uhm..."

    Tr "I don’t know actually…{w=[q]} haha…"

    An "Eh...?"

    Tr "Well, the last time it happened was three hundred years ago."

    Tr "Anyone who witnessed it firsthand is already gone."

    Tr "All we have left are incomplete fragments from the past."

    Tr "I do want to witness it though, for what it’s worth.{w=[q]}
    They say it’s a great light show to seal the night!"

    An "Light shows huh?{w=[q]} Plenty of great light shows back in the capital!"

    Tr "Really? I haven’t really seen them.{w=[q]} Only ever glimpses beyond the trees."

    An "Oh, yes.{w=[q]} They’re wonderful."

    An "Maybe I should show them to you someday."

    An "If I ever could…{w=[q]} haaah…"

    "Saying those things brought me back to the real gravity of the situation;{w=[q]}
    as if in that brief moment I had forgotten why I was here in the first place."
    
    "It was comforting that even though she knew who I was,
    she still spoke to me so casually."

    "Everyone in the court always tensed up when speaking to me."

    #---

    "The women stayed away from me."

    "All the men wanted was to court me."

    "Everyone else dared not to even meet my gaze."

    "The only people I could find comfort in were those closest to me.{w=[s]}
    Only ever to Alexei and Mother."

    "If this whole ordeal didn’t happen,
    would I have had a good relationship with my sisters too?{w=[q]} Maybe even father?"

    "Maybe that could’ve quelled the loneliness I felt in that court."
